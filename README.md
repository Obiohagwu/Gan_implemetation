# Gan_implemetation
A short introduction to GAN's by implementing some GAN papers. Will do more on this in time.

## What are GANS?
As you probably know, GANS are generative adverserial networks; key words - *GENERATIVE* and *ADVERSERIAL*.
It is a special class of neural network modelling as operates on the basis of adverserializing outputs between the generator and the discriminator.
